\chapter{Effective and quantum action}

Effective and quantum action allows to consider only either connected Feynman diagrams or diagrams that cannot be contracted to a point, starting from the partition function. 

\section{Wilsonian effective action}

We start with a pragmatic observation: In computing the asymptotic expansion of $\mathcal Z$, we needed to take into account both connected and disconnected graphs. 

























\subsection{Integrating out fields}

\section{The 1pl effective action}
